# Project on Churning the Email Inbox with Python. 
In this project, I have used Python to access the data from files and process it to achieve 
certain tasks. I explored the MBox email dataset, and used Python to count lines, 
headers, subject lines by emails and domains.

## Skills:
- Python
- File Handling in Python
